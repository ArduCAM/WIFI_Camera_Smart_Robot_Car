 > 1. You can try reduce the value of the turnTime by changing #define  turnTime    300
 
 # Q6: In Start Tracking mode, I can't a good result.
 
 A6:
 > You can change the TrackFactorUp and TrackFactorDown to adjust the value of tracking
 > If the car deviate too far from the trail line,you can increase the value of TrackFactorUp and reduce the value of  
 > TrackFactorDown.
 > If the car is shaking very badly, even turn around,you'd better reduce the  value of the TrackFactorUp and increase the value       >  of rackFactorDown
